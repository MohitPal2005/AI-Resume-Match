# 🎯 AI Resume Match

**AI-powered resume screening & job recommendation system, built on a real RAG pipeline.**

Upload a resume, pick a job — a semantic embedding model finds the true overlap,
and a free LLM explains the score in plain English.

## Overview

**AI Resume Match** (formally: *AI Resume Screening & Job Recommendation System*)
is a full-stack application that screens resumes against job postings using
real semantic AI — not keyword regex dressed up as "AI." It's built end-to-end:
a working REST API, an embedding-based matching engine, LLM-generated
explanations, and a production React frontend, all deployed live and free.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 **Real resume parsing** — extracts text from PDF and DOCX resumes
- 🧠 **Semantic matching** — `sentence-transformers` embeddings + cosine similarity, not string matching
- 🔍 **Skill diffing** — automatically surfaces matched vs. missing skills against a job description
- 🤖 **LLM-generated explanations** — a RAG pipeline feeds the retrieved match context to Llama 3 (via Groq) to explain *why* a candidate scored what they did
- 📊 **Live dashboard** — real screening stats pulled from the database, not mock data
- 💼 **Custom or sample job postings** — screen against a preset job or paste your own JD
- 🆓 **Zero-cost stack** — every service used (Hugging Face Spaces, Vercel, Groq free tier) has a genuinely free tier

## 🧬 How it works — the RAG pipeline

```
Resume (PDF/DOCX)  ─┐
                     ├─► Text Extraction ─► sentence-transformers embeddings ─┐
Job Description  ───┘                                                        │
                                                                                ▼
                                                              Cosine Similarity → Match Score
                                                                                │
                                              Skill keyword extraction & diff ◄─┘
                                                                                │
                                                                                ▼
                                              Matched + Missing skills  ──►  Groq LLM (Llama 3)
                                                                                │
                                                                                ▼
                                                          Plain-English explanation of the score
```

1. **Retrieve** — the resume and job description are embedded using
   [`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
   (free, runs on CPU, no API key). Cosine similarity between the two embeddings
   produces the match score — genuine semantic overlap, not exact keyword hits.
2. **Augment** — a curated skill vocabulary is matched against both texts via
   regex to find exactly which skills overlap and which are missing.
3. **Generate** — that retrieved context (score + matched/missing skills) is
   passed to a free LLM (Llama 3 via [Groq](https://console.groq.com)) which
   writes a 2-3 sentence explanation grounded in the actual data. If no
   `GROQ_API_KEY` is configured, a template-based explanation is used instead
   — the app is always fully functional, with or without the LLM key.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] User authentication (recruiter vs. job seeker roles)
- [ ] Batch resume upload (screen multiple candidates at once)
- [ ] Persistent cloud database (currently SQLite, resets on Space restart)
